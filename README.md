## 🌟 About

Before the days of streaming services, we relied on physical devices to store our limited libraries of 
music. Now with the streaming age, we no longer rely on physical storage and have endless hours of songs 
at our disposal. This project is an homage to the good 'ol days. A mix of the old and new. Experience the 
iPod Classic you used to own that now connects to Spotify and Apple Music — the two most popular music 
streaming platforms in the world.

**iPod.js** recreates the iconic iPod Classic experience in your browser, complete with the signature click wheel navigation and that satisfying tactile feel (Android only) — but now powered by **Spotify** and **Apple Music**, giving you access to millions of songs.

Built with extensibility in mind, this isn't just a music player. It can run games (like the classic Brick game!), and there's room for many more apps and easter eggs in the future.

## 🌟 About

Before the days of streaming services, we relied on physical devices to store our limited libraries of 
music. Now with the streaming age, we no longer rely on physical storage and have endless hours of songs 
at our disposal. This project is an homage to the good 'ol days. A mix of the old and new. Experience the 
iPod Classic you used to own that now connects to Spotify and Apple Music — the two most popular music 
streaming platforms in the world.

**iPod.js** recreates the iconic iPod Classic experience in your browser, complete with the signature click wheel navigation and that satisfying tactile feel (Android only) — but now powered by **Spotify** and **Apple Music**, giving you access to millions of songs.

Built with extensibility in mind, this isn't just a music player. It can run games (like the classic Brick game!), and there's room for many more apps and easter eggs in the future.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version specified in `.tool-versions`)
- **pnpm** package manager
- **Vercel CLI** (optional, for deployment)

```bash
# Use the recommended Node version (if using asdf)

pnpm dev
```

Visit **[http://127.0.0.1:3000/ipod](http://127.0.0.1:3000/ipod)** to experience the magic! ✨

> ⚠️ **Important**: You must use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` due to Spotify's redirect URI requirements.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Spotify Configuration
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret

# Apple Music Configuration  
APPLE_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your_apple_developer_token
```

### 🎵 Spotify Setup

1. Create a Spotify app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Add `http://127.0.0.1:3000/ipod` to your app's redirect URIs
   - ⚠️ **Important**: Use `127.0.0.1` (not `localhost`) — Spotify no longer accepts `localhost` in redirect URIs
3. Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

📚 [Spotify Web Playback SDK Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)

### 🍎 Apple Music Setup
